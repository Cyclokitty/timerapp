Timer app
========

A [tutorial](http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/06/Build-your-First-Electron-App/) that makes a simple countdown timer.

To run:

```

electron . 30

```

30 is the number of seconds.

Changes I made:

* I added back the frame and made it movable. I hate static app windows that sit smack in the middle of the screen

* changed the text-shadow colour from blue to sunset orange. It's shinier.
